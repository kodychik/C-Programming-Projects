In this Repository there are 2 other branches containing all my projects in C.

In "C-Projects" there are 3 C-Projects including:
- a turtle project that draws lines depending on colour and direction input using linked lists
- a image compression project depending on user input using binary search trees
- a social media app mimicking facebook using graphs, breadth first search and depth first search

In "Mini-Programming-Projects-In-C" there are a plethora of little mini games where I explore C and master the language.
